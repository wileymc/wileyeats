Reconnecting with true old friends is something special.  Introducing your lover and partner to those friends adds another element of continuity and deliverance to that rekindling.  And then we share a meal.  After a long day of travel, a good old bud has prepped a poke bowl supreme for the four of us. 

We enjoyed a base of coconut creamed rice topped with cubed, honey chili broiled salmon nuggets, peach-o-de-gayo, avocado, pickled jalepe√±os, and a chipotle may to top it all off. Absolutely phenomenal simnplicity and flavor, with views overlooking Lake Champlain and a sparkling rose to enliven our souls.  

Overall score: `10/10`
Cost: `Priceless`
