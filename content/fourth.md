Honey Road is excellent.  We started with some refreshing gin drinks and some middle eastern dips.  The babaganoush with a floral topping and the muhammara, a smokey red pepper spread that we at with fresh pita and a "lamb cracker."  The lamb cracker was unique, a toasted flatbread with rich lamb grease flavor.  

The mezze included a grilled eggplant with a curried aoli, a salad with delicious beets topped with a falafel crumble, a fantastic lamb bun garnished with pickles, and a tuna tartare taco wrapped in bib lettuce. The tuna could have used some more flavor, but all other dishes were crafted expertly.
