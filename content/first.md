Not much is open in Minneapolis after 9pm on a Wednesday these days.  We ended in the downtown district, a ghost town, and found ourselves at Fhima's Minneapolis, a Mediterranean inspired eatery with an art deco spin on the middle east.  

The cocktails were excellent–—A bee pollen gin drink and the morroccan mojito.  We ordered the wedge salad, an onion and fig tarte, and the "taste of morocco" platter.  

Everything came at once.  The wedge salad was the least inspiring of the dishes featuring a tough and dry piece of pork belly that was certainly not fit for even a cut-rate show dog on vacation.  The tarte was interesting with a fantastic spicy red sauce on the side that added a nice kick to the sweet and savory onion pie.  Lastly, the moroccan sampler platter was a bit...lacking.  It did feature some decent flavors, including a great "shakshuka" but the portions were laughable.  Small shmears of each spread made the serving dish look larger than it actually was, and it was fucking huge.  The best thing we at was undoubtedly the pita bread which was soft, warm, and allegedly freshly baked from a 120 year old starter, according to the owners son who was made us look impoverished with his custom tailored italian suit.  

Overall score: `4.5/10`
Cost: $$$
