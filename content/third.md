We we're blessed with an incredible dinner at Poco in Burlington last night.  We warmed up with some summery cocktails with coconut and rum.  Plates then started coming, and continued coming. We ate, in no particular order, a unique ceasar salad with napa cabbage, topped with crispy chicken skins in lieu of crutons.  A perfectly cooked duck leg on a bed of greens with plum.  Ground pork don don noodles.  Grilled shrimp on a tangy and spicy romanesco sauce. Cauliflower over carrot puree.  Pork belly in a savory fish sauce with pears.  Grilled brocolli with a spicy peanut sauce.
